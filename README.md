### Designed and implemented a Java based GUI app for designing 4 kinds of tension members using Java Swing library in NETBEANS IDE 8.2
#### • Utilized Java Swing Palette to design the layout and appearance of interface, including buttons, labels, text fields, and other graphical components.
#### • Employed event-driven programming techniques to specify the behavior of the interface, including handling user input and triggering various actions.
#### • Executed Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on the .exe using cleanup and build method, finalized a stand-alone app installer using install creator pro.
## Test Case Screen 1 - Selecting a Tension Member out of the given options

## Test Case Screen 2 - Input all the values for the tension member. The program prompts the user to completely fill all the input boxes, then open the output file.

## Test Case Screen 3 - Showing all the input values in a glance and presenting all the calculations performed while obtaining the optimal section.

## Test Case Screen 3 - Obtaining the result and concluding the dimensions of the most optimal section to use under the input conditions to avoid gross section yielding, net section rupture, and block shear failure. Like in this case it is - 65X65X8
